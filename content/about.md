My name is Riana Hadiana and I am a data lover. I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming language R, soccer, futsal, and playing games (Real Racing 3 and FIFA mobile). I studied Statistics (formal) and Computer Science (non-formal), finishing my master in 2019. I live in Serang and Lampung, Indonesia, with my job and my family.
